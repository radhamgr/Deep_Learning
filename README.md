# Deep_Learning
Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, utilizes a hierarchical level of artificial neural networks to carry out the process of machine learning. The artificial neural networks are built like the human brain, with neuron nodes connected together like a web. 
# Artificial Neural Networks
Neural Networks consist of the following components

-An input layer, x

-An arbitrary amount of hidden layers

-An output layer, ŷ

-A set of weights and biases between each layer, W and b

-A choice of activation function for each hidden layer, σ. In this tutorial, we’ll use a Sigmoid activation function.

-An optimizer to update weights and biases to minimize the error in output.
# Convolutional Neural Networks
In neural networks, Convolutional neural network (ConvNets or CNNs) is one of the main categories to do images recognition, images classifications. Objects detections, recognition faces etc., are some of the areas where CNNs are widely used.
